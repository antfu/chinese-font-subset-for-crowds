# Chinese font subset generator for [Crowds](https://github.com/ncase/crowds)
This repo is for solving the problem of large size of Chinese font, which is dissused at [here](https://github.com/illyasviel/crowds/pull/15)(in Chinese).

The basic technique is to extract all the Chinese characters appears in `zh-CN.html` file, and make a subset font for them only. This can reduce the font size effectively.

**Downside**: This font become less flexible since it's only have font for the appeared characters. And you many need to generate the font again once you changed the text of `zh-CN.html` file
